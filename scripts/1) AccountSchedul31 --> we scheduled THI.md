1) AccountSchedul31 --> we scheduled THIS using ORG or system.schedule. 
2) we are trying to update accountsSchedule class (which is already scheduled in first step)
    - by default it will NOT allow us to change it.

3) if we want to CHANGE code even IF schedule exists, then go to deployment settings and check deployment options.

4) try to deploy code again. and DONE.
